I personally use and recommend <a href=\"https://technitium.com/dns/\">Technitium DNS</a>, a free and open source DNS server.</p>\n\n<p>Technitium allows you to enforce that all DNS queries are encrypted, either via <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS\">DNS-over-TLS</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS\">DNS-over-HTTPS,</a> which prevents your ISP from being able to see all of your DNS requests unencrypted. Additionally, you can block ads and malware that may have slipped through your other defenses by using a <a href=\"https://blog.technitium.com/2018/10/blocking-internet-ads-using-dns-sinkhole.html\">DNS Sinkhole</a>. Basically, if a domain is requested which is in any of your configured block lists, Technitium just resolves the IP of the domain to an invalid IP address, 0.0.0.0.</p>\n\n<figure><p><a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7LaQCM7c--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/od866qvj9cjggbkpsit4.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7LaQCM7c--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/od866qvj9cjggbkpsit4.png\" alt=\"DNS blocked domains\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></p>\n<figcaption>Top domains blocked over the last one week by my Technitium DNS server</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h1>\n  <a name=\"vpn\" href=\"#vpn\" class=\"anchor\">\n  </a>\n  VPN\n</h1>\n\n<figure><p><a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PCoOs3cQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/8lbyl028lyjx961qbgr1.jpg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PCoOs3cQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/8lbyl028lyjx961qbgr1.jpg\" alt=\"Alt Text\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></p>\n<figcaption>Always use protection.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to truly be fully anonymous online, you’ll need to use a 3rd party <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network\">VPN</a> service. However, not all VPNs are created equal; you need to make sure you choose a VPN provider with a strict no-logging policy. I use and can recommend <a href=\"https://nordvpn.com/features/strict-no-logs-policy/\">NordVPN</a>.</p>\n\n<p>NordVPN has a strict no-logging policy, and this policy has been verified by independent auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers AG, one of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_accounting_firms\">Big Four auditing firms</a>. NordVPN <a href=\"https://support.nordvpn.com/General-info/Features/1061811142/Jurisdiction-we-operate-in.htm\">operates within the jurisdiction of Panama</a>, which has no legislation regarding mandatory data retention, unlike the US and EU; this is a good thing for a VPN provider. Such a strict no-logging policy could not exist legally under US or EU jurisdiction. You can even pay for your NordVPN subscription with cryptocurrency, without ever leaving a trace of your real identity.</p>\n\n<h1>\n  <a name=\"the-onion-router-tor\" href=\"#the-onion-router-tor\" class=\"anchor\">\n  </a>\n  The Onion Router (Tor)\n</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FppOtxeq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/fkarzixxtgxoyrwkmhgo.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FppOtxeq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/fkarzixxtgxoyrwkmhgo.png\" alt=\"Tor logo\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></p>\n\n<p>If you want to go <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden\">Edward Snowden</a> level private, NordVPN also has a feature called <a href=\"https://nordvpn.com/features/onion-over-vpn/\">Onion Over VPN</a>. When connected to an Onion Over VPN server, all your internet traffic gets routed through a VPN server, then through a <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\">Tor</a> proxy, and only then reaches the Internet. You can, of course, just use Tor directly via the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/\">Tor Browser</a> without a VPN at all, but this still opens you up to some vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n<p>If you use Tor without a VPN, your ISP will know you are using Tor to access the internet, though this alone doesn’t compromise the actual data being sent and received over Tor. However, your IP address can still be compromised if there is a snooper, or multiple snoopers, in the network.</p>\n\n<p>Tor node servers are volunteer-operated; anyone, including authorities or other bad actors, can set up and operate a Tor node. While no single node is able to see the full network request or response, someone operating multiple servers which your request/response is routed through — especially entry or exist nodes — can discover your real IP address with a little work. For this reason, I still recommend using a VPN provider with Tor. That way, if your IP address is compromised, it’s just a VPN IP address and no real identifying information is compromised.</p>\n\n<h1>\n  <a name=\"i-have-nothing-to-hide-why-should-i-care\" href=\"#i-have-nothing-to-hide-why-should-i-care\" class=\"anchor\">\n  </a>\n  “I have nothing to hide.

But the lion’s share of Google products are free; Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Google Photos, Google Meet, YouTube, etc. So how does Google make <em>so much money</em>? Simple.

Reusing a password for multiple accounts is a security risk. A decent password manager can automatically detect signup forms in your browser and offer to generate a secure, strong password for you, sync your passwords between devices, and warn you if you have any weak, compromised, or reused passwords. I personally use a <a href=\"https://1password.com/\">1Password</a> family account at home and a team account at work, and I can confidently recommend 1Password, but <a href=\"https://www.dashlane.com/\">Dashlane</a> is another great option.

At DuckDuckGo, we believe online privacy should be simple.\n\n*   Blocks hidden trackers\n*   Enforce HTTPS encrypted connections where possible\n*   Gives each website a “Privacy Grade” (A-F) so you can see how protected you are at a glance\n*   Option to send standardized [Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/) signal to websites you visit\n*   [Open source](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-privacy-extension)\n\nuBlock Origin\n-------------\n\n[Download](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)\n\n> uBlock Origin is **not** an “ad blocker”, it’s a wide-spectrum content blocker with CPU and memory efficiency as a primary feature.\n\n*   Filters and blocks content based on block lists\n*   Add additional popular community block lists\n*   Block specific elements on a page manually or automatically\n*   Add custom global or local filtering and blocking rules for content and/or Javascript\n*   [Open source](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock)\n\nPrivacy Badger\n--------------\n\n[Download](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17/)\n\n> Privacy Badger automatically learns to block invisible trackers. Instead of keeping lists of what to block, Privacy Badger automatically discovers trackers based on their behavior.\n\n*   Sends standardized [Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/) and [Do Not Track](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track) signals to websites you visit\n*   Blocks scripts that do not respect the Global Privacy Control or Do Not Track signals\n*   [Open source](https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger)\n\nHTTPS Everywhere\n----------------\n\n[Download](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/https-everywhere/)\n\n> Many sites on the web offer some limited support for encryption over HTTPS, but make it difficult to use. For instance, they may default to unencrypted HTTP, or fill encrypted pages with links that go back to the unencrypted site. The HTTPS Everywhere extension fixes these problems by rewriting all requests to these sites to HTTPS.\n\n*   Attempts to upgrade insecure HTTP connections to secure HTTPS connections\n*   If HTTP→HTTPS upgrade is not possible, blocks the insecure HTTP connection by default\n*   [Open source](https://github.com/EFForg/https-everywhere)\n\nClearURLs\n---------\n\n[Download](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clearurls/)\n\n> This extension will automatically remove tracking elements from URLs to help protect your privacy when browsing through the Internet.\n\n*   Automatically removes URL tracking parameters like Google Analytics parameters and Amazon tracking parameters\n*   Uses over 250 URL matching rules, matches a huge set of trackers\n*   [Open source](https://gitlab.com/KevinRoebert/ClearUrls)\n\nDNS\n===\n\n![Statistics from my Technitium DNS server](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/fjyyuvz1hykxervd1c48.png)\n<figcaption>Real stats from my Technitium DNS server.</figcaption>\n\nIf you want to take your privacy one step further, you can prevent your Internet Service Provider (ISP) from detecting every single site you request by running your own custom, encrypted [DNS server](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dns-server-2625854). I personally use and recommend [Technitium DNS](https://technitium.com/dns/), a free and open source DNS server.\n\nTechnitium allows you to enforce that all DNS queries are encrypted, either via [DNS-over-TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS) or [DNS-over-HTTPS,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS) which prevents your ISP from being able to see all of your DNS requests unencrypted. Additionally, you can block ads and malware that may have slipped through your other defenses by using a [DNS Sinkhole](https://blog.technitium.com/2018/10/blocking-internet-ads-using-dns-sinkhole.html). Basically, if a domain is requested which is in any of your configured block lists, Technitium just resolves the IP of the domain to an invalid IP address, 0.0.0.0.\n\n![DNS blocked domains](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/od866qvj9cjggbkpsit4.png)\n<figcaption>Top domains blocked over the last one week by my Technitium DNS server</figcaption>\n\nVPN\n===\n\n![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/8lbyl028lyjx961qbgr1.jpg)\n<figcaption>Always use protection.</figcaption>\n\nIf you want to truly be fully anonymous online, you’ll need to use a 3rd party [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) service. However, not all VPNs are created equal; you need to make sure you choose a VPN provider with a strict no-logging policy. I use and can recommend [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/features/strict-no-logs-policy/).\n\nNordVPN has a strict no-logging policy, and this policy has been verified by independent auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers AG, one of the [Big Four auditing firms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_accounting_firms). NordVPN [operates within the jurisdiction of Panama](https://support.nordvpn.com/General-info/Features/1061811142/Jurisdiction-we-operate-in.htm), which has no legislation regarding mandatory data retention, unlike the US and EU; this is a good thing for a VPN provider. Such a strict no-logging policy could not exist legally under US or EU jurisdiction. You can even pay for your NordVPN subscription with cryptocurrency, without ever leaving a trace of your real identity.\n\nThe Onion Router (Tor)\n======================\n\n![Tor logo](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/fkarzixxtgxoyrwkmhgo.png)\n\nIf you want to go [Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden) level private, NordVPN also has a feature called [Onion Over VPN](https://nordvpn.com/features/onion-over-vpn/). When connected to an Onion Over VPN server, all your internet traffic gets routed through a VPN server, then through a [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) proxy, and only then reaches the Internet. You can, of course, just use Tor directly via the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) without a VPN at all, but this still opens you up to some vulnerabilities.\n\nIf you use Tor without a VPN, your ISP will know you are using Tor to access the internet, though this alone doesn’t compromise the actual data being sent and received over Tor. However, your IP address can still be compromised if there is a snooper, or multiple snoopers, in the network.\n\nTor node servers are volunteer-operated; anyone, including authorities or other bad actors, can set up and operate a Tor node. While no single node is able to see the full network request or response, someone operating multiple servers which your request/response is routed through — especially entry or exist nodes — can discover your real IP address with a little work. For this reason, I still recommend using a VPN provider with Tor. That way, if your IP address is compromised, it’s just a VPN IP address and no real identifying information is compromised.\n\n“I have nothing to hide. Why should I care?”\n============================================\n\n![Edward Snowden](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/806wxb0vir7sgo9tw5nf.jpg)\n<figcaption>If you’re asking this, Edward Snowden is disappointed.</figcaption>\n\nPrivacy Is Your Right\n---------------------\n\nPrivacy is a right, but it’s not one we’ve always had; in fact, people in several authoritarian nations around the world, people still don’t have the right to privacy. And it’s one of the most important rights, right behind the right to free speech. Those who came before us fought so that we could enjoy the right to privacy, and dismissing that is grossly ignorant of history and its importance.\n\nYour Data Has Value\n-------------------\n\nGoogle is [among the top 5 richest companies in the world](https://moneyinc.com/richest-companies-in-the-world-in-2019/) when ranked by market cap. But the lion’s share of Google products are free; Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Google Photos, Google Meet, YouTube, etc. So how does Google make _so much money_? Simple. They sell your personal user data to third parties. Why should a global mega-corporation be allowed to profit freely and massively from your personal user data?\n\nYou Have No Idea How Much Is Out There\n--------------------------------------\n\nMost of the time, apathy about online privacy is actually a symptom of ignorance. Studies show that even those who are initially unbothered by online privacy issues [become concerned when confronted with the amount and nature of data collection](https://www.eff.org/files/willis_and_zeljkovic.pdf).\n\nIf a stranger asked you to to fill out a 150 question form regarding personal information, with the express intention to sell that data to 3rd parties, would you consent?\n\nHonorable Mentions\n==================\n\nThere are several other privacy tools that I haven’t covered here, but are definitely worth an honorable mention.\n\nPassword Managers\n-----------------\n\nEveryone should be using a password manager. Reusing a password for multiple accounts is a security risk. A decent password manager can automatically detect signup forms in your browser and offer to generate a secure, strong password for you, sync your passwords between devices, and warn you if you have any weak, compromised, or reused passwords. I personally use a [1Password](https://1password.com/) family account at home and a team account at work, and I can confidently recommend 1Password, but [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/) is another great option. If you’re looking for a free and completely offline solution, you can check out [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/).\n\n[PrivacyTool.io](https://privacytools.io/)\n------------------------------------------\n\n*   Privacy-respecting search engine to find more privacy tools\n*   Privacy-focused services and software\n*   Non-profit and open source\n\n[DeleteMe](https://joindeleteme.com/)\n-------------------------------------\n\n*   Automatically opt-out of the sale of your personal information by over 40 of the biggest data brokers\n*   Provides DIY guides to manually opt-out for free\n\n[haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n*   Historical records of data breaches\n*   Check if any accounts associated with your email address have been compromised\n","user":{"name":"Mat Jones","username":"matjones","twitter_username":null,"github_username":"mrjones2014","website_url":"https://mjones.network","profile_image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rzQaKEWl--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_640,q_auto,w_640/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_image/561062/dde6a19b-1df3-4ed3-b723-86424694d93f.png","profile_image_90":"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lIbHS3Lt--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_90,q_auto,w_90/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_image/561062/dde6a19b-1df3-4ed3-b723-86424694d93f.png"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
