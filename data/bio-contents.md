# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Mat.

I'm a full-stack software engineer, passionate about online privacy, security, accessibility,
and dark themes. ðŸ˜Ž

My favorite back end languages include C#, TypeScript (Node.js), and Kotlin.
On the front end, I'm currently enjoying Next.js and React Hooks,
but I also love Vue.js, [Mint](https://www.mint-lang.com/), and I'm always learning new tech.

When I'm not writing code, I'm tinkering with my home lab server and network setup.
