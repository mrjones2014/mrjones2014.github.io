# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Mat.

I'm a software engineer, passionate about online privacy, accessibility, clean code,
and dark themes. I attended York College of Pennsylvania on a full tuition scholarship,
and graduated in 2018 with a bachelors degree in computer science and a minor in mathematics.

I've been programming since 2010, and doing professional web stack engineering since 2017
when I helped launch a small tech startup. I'm a strong self-starter, always learning new
technology, and I pride myself on being able to jump into just about any tech stack with
relative ease.

When I'm not writing code, I'm tinkering with my home lab server and network. Currently in my
home lab, I'm running a [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) private cloud, a
[Plex Media Server](https://www.plex.tv/), and a [Samba](https://www.samba.org/) file share,
all running on [TrueNAS](https://www.truenas.com/).
